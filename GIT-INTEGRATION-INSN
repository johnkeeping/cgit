merge blame

  In its own branch upstream.  May need changing to avoid exec'ing git-blame.

  Add a blame UI.

. merge no-cache-errors

  Prelimnary steps towards avoiding caching error pages or reducing the
  amount of time for which they are cached.

  Conflicts with "blame", so this is disabled until I see where that goes.

merge runtime-sendtime

  Allow the use of sendfile(2) to be disabled in cgitrc.

merge jk/compat-timegm

  Submitted to cgit@hjemli.net but not applied.

  Need to see if there is an alternative to introducing a compat function.
  Doing the back and forth in the local timezone is mostly good enough,
  but doesn't handle DST correctly.

merge test-improvements

  WIP improvements to make the test suite more robust.

merge scan-exclude

  An experiment to handle a certain use case.  Probably not desirable.
