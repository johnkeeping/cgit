merge diff-summary

  Suggested-by: Konstantin Ryabitsev <mricon@kernel.org>

merge jk/compat-timegm

  Submitted to cgit@hjemli.net but not applied.

  Need to see if there is an alternative to introducing a compat function.
  Doing the back and forth in the local timezone is mostly good enough,
  but doesn't handle DST correctly.

merge log-follow-files

  In its own branch upstream.

merge test-improvements

  WIP improvements to make the test suite more robust.

merge scan-exclude

  An experiment to handle a certain use case.  Probably not desirable.
