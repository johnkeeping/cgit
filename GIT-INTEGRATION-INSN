merge fix-no-repo-segv

  Fix a segfault with certain invalid combinations of URL parameters.

merge jk/ignore-sigpipe

merge atom-quote-url

  Fix escaping an attribute value in the Atom feed.

merge jk/email-angle-brackets

  Remove angle brackets from our internal representation of email addresses.

merge render-mode

  Allow including rendered content in ui-blob.

merge afl

  Experiment to allow using AFL to fuzz CGit.

. merge blame

  In its own branch upstream.  May need changing to avoid exec'ing git-blame.

  Conflicts hideously with render-mode.

  Add a blame UI.

. merge no-cache-errors

  Final step to completely avoid caching error pages, but I'm not sure we want
  this; the existing behaviour of using "cache-dynamic-ttl" may be enough.

. merge streaming

  WIP converting to Git's streaming interface for large blobs.

  This appears to regress performance notably for moderately sized files.

merge runtime-sendfile

  Allow the use of sendfile(2) to be disabled in cgitrc.

merge jk/compat-timegm

  Submitted to cgit@hjemli.net but not applied.

  Need to see if there is an alternative to introducing a compat function.
  Doing the back and forth in the local timezone is mostly good enough,
  but doesn't handle DST correctly.

. merge test-improvements

  WIP improvements to make the test suite more robust.

. merge scan-exclude

  An experiment to handle a certain use case.  Probably not desirable.
