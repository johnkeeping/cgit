merge git-2.0.3

  Update to Git v2.0.3.

  Submitted upstream.

merge jk/compat-timegm

  Submitted to cgit@hjemli.net but not applied.

  Need to see if there is an alternative to introducing a compat function.
  Doing the back and forth in the local timezone is mostly good enough,
  but doesn't handle DST correctly.

merge log-follow-files

  In its own branch upstream.

merge test-improvements

  WIP improvements to make the test suite more robust.

merge scan-exclude

  An experiment to handle a certain use case.  Probably not desirable.
