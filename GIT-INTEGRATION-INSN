merge blame

  In its own branch upstream.  May need changing to avoid exec'ing git-blame.

  Add a blame UI.

. merge no-cache-errors

  Final step to completely avoid caching error pages, but I'm not sure we want
  this; the existing behaviour of using "cache-dynamic-ttl" may be enough.

merge ident-tz

  Show timestamps in the originator's timezone instead of the server's
  when the "local-time" option is not enabled.

  This changes the format from "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S (%Z)" to something
  more like RFC2822, which breaks the layout of right-aligned date
  fields.  Ideally we need to update git.git so that DATE_LOCAL is a
  modifier rather than a separate mode, otherwise we will be using a
  different format in local and originator time formatting.

merge streaming

  WIP converting to Git's streaming interface for large blobs.

merge runtime-sendtime

  Allow the use of sendfile(2) to be disabled in cgitrc.

merge jk/compat-timegm

  Submitted to cgit@hjemli.net but not applied.

  Need to see if there is an alternative to introducing a compat function.
  Doing the back and forth in the local timezone is mostly good enough,
  but doesn't handle DST correctly.

merge test-improvements

  WIP improvements to make the test suite more robust.

merge scan-exclude

  An experiment to handle a certain use case.  Probably not desirable.
